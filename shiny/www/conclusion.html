<p>Overall, the idea was ambitious, but our take away was, with more data, we feel there is merit to making a prediction based on what characters are in an episode and how much screen time they have.</p>

<p>While we had a robust number of characters and screen times, we only had 67 episodes to work with. We needed more episodes (through put) to enhance the models abilities to predict</p>

<p>For next steps, or with more time, we would have liked to explored:
<ul style="margin-left:20px">
  <li>Digging into demographic data more to make ratings based on age group, gender</li>
  <li>Build models for Fan Favorites by Demographic based on the ratings</li>
  <li>Could we predict, with all actor data (not character) whether a show/movie would be a hit based on their screen time in that movie?</li>
  <li>Work on a better categorization method to run random forest</li>
</ul>
