##### Game of Thrones:  Executive Summary

Executive Summary:

Game of Thrones (GoT) is a fantasy TV-series that premiered on HBO in 2011; it is an adaption of the book series written by George R.R Martin. Due to the popularity and continued success of Game of Thrones, our project idea was to take the User Ratings provided by IMBD, and a data source providing each characters screen time, and come up with a predictive model, that given the characters in an episode and their screen time, to predict what the rating for the episode will be.

In addition, we decided to create a Shiny R Application to present our findings in a more interactive way.

The source code for the Shiny Application is here:
